# Nasa-Space-App-Game-
This was a 02 days Nasa Hackathon project 2022. The theme we worked on was making a video game to visualize space travel hazards for players. It was a great experience for me as I tried to mess with gravity phisics in 2d for the first time and adjusted the spaceship "main character" controls. the project was made with Unity + C# language.
